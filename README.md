# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
Upload the source code files together with the csv files in the same folder.
Run the .cpp files on the terminal using g++ compiler.
When prompted to enter the start city and country after running the main.cpp file, type the city then press the enter key before typing the country (eg., Accra, Ghana). 
When prompted to enter the destination city and country, type the city then press the enter key before typing the country (eg., Harare, Zimbabwe).
After the program runs, two text files would be created, eg., Accra-Harare.txt as the input file and Accra-Harare_output.txt as the output file.
The input file will contain the start city (city and country) and the destination city (city and country). The name of the input file is formed by the start and destination cities entered by a user running the program. 
The output file will contain a series of flights from start city to destination city entered by a user. Data in the output file will come from the search algorithm in the program. The name of the output file is also formed from the start and destination cities, with and addition of "_output".
